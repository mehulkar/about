[collegedesis.com](//collegedesis.com) is the best way for members of South Asian student organizations to share news and thoughts  with organizations all around the country.

Here's how it works. We:

1. have a database of almost 700 South Asian organizations around the country.
1. allow users to become _members_ of these organizations.
1. allow registered members of organizations to post links or write blog posts on a News Board
1. trigger [tweets](//twitter.com/collegedesis) and post to [Facebook](//facebook.com/collegedesis) from the News Board

The goal is to:

* make it easier for organizations to share events, activities, and experiences
* inspire national conversations around the topics of race, ethnicity, and religion.
* and to create community.
